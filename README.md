# ML_Classification-algorithms.
This learning involves trying out a variety of classification algorithms and at least one clustering algorithm. It requires use of python, numpy, matplotlib, and sklearn, so it also serves as an introduction to all those tools. Code in jupyter notebook.

There are four dataset: steel-plates-fault, ionosphere, bandnotes, and fake data. /

It applied the following models, in Sklearn:

KNeighborsClassifier (k nearest neighbours)

GaussianNB (the Gaussian form of Naive Bayes)

DecisionTreeClassifier (a decision tree (DT))

LogisticRegression (essentially, a perceptron)

GradientBoostingClassifier (Gradient Boosted DTs)

RandomForestClassifier (random forest, ensemble of DTs)

MLPClassifier (neural net)
